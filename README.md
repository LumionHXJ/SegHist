## üìÑ Abstract

Text line detection is a key task in historical document analysis facing many challenges of arbitrary-shaped text lines, dense texts, and text lines with high aspect ratios, etc. In this paper, we propose a general framework for historical document text detection (SegHist), enabling existing segmentation-based text detection methods to effectively address the challenges, especially text lines with high aspect ratios. Integrating the SegHist framework with the commonly used method DB++, we develop DB-SegHist. This approach achieves SOTA on the CHDAC, MTHv2, and competitive results on HDRC datasets, with a significant improvement of 1.19% on the most challenging CHDAC dataset which features more text lines with high aspect ratios. Moreover, our method attains SOTA on rotated MTHv2 and rotated HDRC, demonstrating its rotational robustness.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Requirements**

Installing using config:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Or installing step-by-step:

```bash
conda create --name openmmlab python=3.8 -y
conda activate openmmlab
conda install pytorch==1.12.1 torchvision==0.13.1 torchaudio==0.12.1 -c pytorch
pip install -U openmim
mim install mmengine==0.10.4 mmcv==2.0.1 mmdet==3.0.0 mmocr==1.0.0rc5
```

## üöÄ **Training**

Training DB-SegHist as example (training other model by changing checkpoint):

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.run --nproc_per_node=4 train.py  --launcher pytorch --work-dir work_dirs/ config/seghist/seghist_resnet50-dcnv2_fpnc.py
```

## üß† **Inferencing**

```bash
python test.py --work-dir work_dirs/ config/seghist/seghist_resnet50-dcnv2_fpnc.py [your_checkpoint]
```
